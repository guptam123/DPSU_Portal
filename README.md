# Knowledge Management Portal
#### This is back-end for the protal made during Smart India Hackathon 2019 for the Defense Public Sector Units(DPSUs) of India under the problem statement by Goa Shipyard Ltd.
# AIM:
DPSUs faced a lot of problems in interfacing with each other or gathering solution to certain problems they may face in their operations. The problems faced by Defence PSUs (DPSUs) can be a simple one such as one company requiring information about the composition of a product which is manufactured by another company; to a complex one, such as an Aeronautics company requiring support for a defect in the RADAR system which has to be integrated with the aircraft. These situations may lead to delay in the production, maintenance or any other process related with the same.\

Hence we had build an online knowledge management portal, which will allow the users to discuss ideas, problems and share knowledge on a common platform. 

# Features: - 
- Central database for storing information with access rights to the a admin and also company wise access to info to the company admin .
- Division of Information is done departmental, company wise, product wise, etc.  
- Sharing of knowledge takes place in the form of posts or articles which is categorized based on topics, products, departments, company, etc. 
- The content can be comprised of text, pictures, videos, etc.  
- Ability to upvote the knowledge piece and ranking them according to their ratings (1-10). Also a comment section for the posts created on the  portal.
